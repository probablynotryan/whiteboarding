Q1: URLs cannot have spaces. Instead, all spaces in a string are replaced with %20. Write an algorithm that replaces all spaces in a string with %20.

You may not use the replace() method or regular expressions to solve this problem. Solve the problem with and without recursion.

const replaceSpaces = (str) => {
  let o = "";
  for (let i = 0; i < str.length; i++) {
    if (str[i] === " ") {
      o += "%20";
    } else {
      o += str[i];
    }
  }
  return o;
}


Q2: Write an algorithm that removes duplicates from an array. Do not use a function like filter() to solve this. Once you have solved the problem, demonstrate how it can be solved with filter(). Solve the problem with and without recursion.
